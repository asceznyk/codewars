# DSA Prep - for Google

The goal is to cover 4-5 leetcode medium or 1-2 hard per day. We have 3 weeks, so that is 21 days, 21*4 is 84. And then, read the CP Handbook.

Try to push it, but keep in mind that problem solving is priority.


## Material 

1. Leetcode - Top Interview Questions - [Medium](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-medium/), [Hard](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-hard/)
2. Geeksforgeeks - Recent Interview Experience - Amazon - SDE2, SDE1
3. Neetcode - Roadmap
4. System Design


## Time 
4 hours everyday - we try to attack the problems for the first 2 weeks without time constraints, then we attack problems with the time constraints.
