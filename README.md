Solutions to problems on codeforces, codewars and leetcode


### ground rules

1. Disable all problem tags.
2. After 30 minutes *of being stuck*, read the first few lines of the editorial. 
3. If you're still stuck, you have a choice to read the whole thing or skip the problem.
4. **Do not** look at the solution code.
